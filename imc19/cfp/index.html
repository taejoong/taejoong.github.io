<h1 id="call-for-papers-acm-imc-2019-amsterdam-netherlands">Call For Papers, ACM IMC 2019, Amsterdam, Netherlands</h1>

<p>The Internet Measurement Conference (IMC) is a highly selective venue for the presentation of measurement-based research in data communications. The focus of IMC 2019 will be on research that improves the practice of network measurement, illuminates some facet of an operational network, or both. We encourage authors to discuss the implications of their results to future research and/or to operations. We also encourage authors to discuss representativeness and limitations of their work due to coverage of their measurements across space and time.</p>

<p>IMC takes a broad view of contributions that are considered in scope for improving the practice of network measurement, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about network structure and network performance (e.g., traffic, topology, routing, energy utilization)</li>
<li>collection and analysis of data that yield new insights about application and end-user behavior (e.g., economics, privacy, security, application interaction with protocols)</li>
<li>modeling of network internals and application behavior (e.g., workloads, scaling behavior, assessment of performance bottlenecks)</li>
<li>methods and tools to monitor and visualize network-based phenomena</li>
<li>novel systems and algorithmic techniques that leverage measurement-based findings</li>
<li>advances in data collection, analysis, and storage (e.g., anonymization, querying, sharing)</li>
<li>reappraisal of previous empirical findings</li>
<li>descriptions of challenges and future directions the measurement community should pursue</li>
</ul>

<p>Operational networks of interest include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Internet backbone</li>
<li>edge networks (e.g., home networks, cellular networks, WLANs)</li>
<li>data center networks and cloud computing infrastructure</li>
<li>software-defined networks and network function virtualization</li>
<li>peer-to-peer, overlay, and content distribution networks</li>
<li>infrastructure for online social networks</li>
<li>experimental networks, prototype networks, and future Internetworks</li>
<li>large-scale distributed systems and online services</li>
</ul>

<p>Authors unsure about topical fit are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs at <a href="mailto:imc2019pcchairs@sigcomm.org">imc2019pcchairs@sigcomm.org</a>.</p>

<h2 id="review-process-and-criteria">Review process and criteria</h2>

<p>IMC 2019 invites two forms of submissions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Full papers (up to 13 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references) that describe original research, with succinctness appropriate to the topics and themes they discuss.</li>
<li>Short papers (up to 6 pages for text and figures + unlimited pages for references) that convey work that is less mature but shows exciting promise, OR offer results that do not merit a full submission. Short papers could articulate a high-level vision and describe challenging future directions that the authors believe the community should tackle; validate, verify, or update important results; or present new ideas that challenge existing assumptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any submission exceeding short paper page-length limit will be evaluated as a full paper.</p>

<p>Authors should only submit original work that has not been published before and is not under submission to any other venue. We will consider full paper submissions that extend previously published short, preliminary papers (including IMC short papers) following the model of the <a href="http://www.sigcomm.org/about/policies/frequently-asked-questions-faq">ACM SIGCOMM policy</a>.</p>

<p>IMC 2019 will bestow two awards on paper submissions, a Best Paper award and a Community Contribution award. The best paper award will recognize the outstanding paper at the conference, and all accepted papers are eligible for it. The community contribution award will recognize a paper with an outstanding contribution to the community in the form of a novel dataset, source code distribution, open platform, or other noteworthy service to the community. To be eligible for the community award, the authors must make publicly available their dataset (e.g., through <a href="http://www.datcat.org/">DatCat</a> for Internet measurement data or <a href="http://crawdad.cs.dartmouth.edu/">CRAWDAD</a> for wireless data) or source code (e.g., via github, bitbucket), or have an open working platform, etc., by the camera-ready deadline. The authors indicate their eligibility on the submission form and are also encouraged to include a link to the contribution in the submitted paper itself.</p>

<p>A few accepted papers may be forwarded for fast-track submission to <a href="http://www.ieee-acm-ton.org/">IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking</a>.</p>

<h2 id="ethical-considerations">Ethical Considerations</h2>

<p>Papers describing experiments with users or sensitive user data (e.g., network traffic, passwords, social network information) must follow basic precepts of ethical research and subscribe to community norms. These include: respect for privacy, secure storage of sensitive data, voluntary and informed consent if users are placed at risk, avoiding deceptive practices when not essential, beneficence (maximizing the benefits to an individual or to society while minimizing harm to the individual), and risk mitigation. When appropriate, authors are encouraged to include a subsection describing these issues. Authors may want to consult the <a href="http://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2012/menlo_report_actual_formatted/">Menlo Report</a> for further information on ethical principles and the <a href="http://conferences.sigcomm.org/imc/2007/papers/imc80.pdf">Allman/Paxson IMC 07</a> paper for guidance on ethical data sharing.</p>

<p>Note that submitting research for approval by each author’s institutional ethics review body is necessary, but not sufficient – in cases where the PC has concerns about the ethics of the work in a submission, the PC will consider the ethical soundness and justification of any paper, just as it does its technical soundness. The PC takes a broad view of what constitutes an ethical concern, and authors agree to be available at any time during the review process to rapidly respond to queries from the PC chairs regarding ethical considerations. Authors unsure about ethical issues are welcome to contact the program committee co-chairs at <a href="mailto:imc2019pcchairs@sigcomm.org">imc2019pcchairs@sigcomm.org</a>.</p>

## IMC 2019 Shadow PC

To provide an educational experience by exposing students to a review process and to subsequently train the next generation of program committee (PC), the ACM IMC 2019 TPC would like 
to make submitted papers available to the shadow PC. Shadow PCs allow students and others interested in future PC service to read submitted papers and go through the reviewing 
process, ultimately arriving at a shadow conference program. This opportunity allows future PC members to learn first-hand about the peer-review process and gain experience as a 
reviewer.
The shadow PC process is run on a different system, and the shadow PC reviewers will not have any access to the real reviews, the names of the real reviewers, or any other data such 
as relative rankings. Shadow PC reviewers will have to abide by the same rules and restrictions applicable to regular PC members. This includes, but is not limited to, rules against 
discussing the papers outside of the PC context, or using in any way results from reviewed papers before such papers have been published. Delegated reviews (i.e. external reviews) are 
not allowed for the shadow PC. Making a submitted paper available to the shadow PC is optional; authors will have the opportunity to decide during the paper submission process. Shadow 
reviews for papers that are reviewed by the shadow PC will be sent out after the actual IMC’18 review process.
Authors who have participated in previous shadow PCs have found the additional reviews helpful; however, these reviews will have no bearing on acceptance to the technical program. You 
can directly contribute to a successful shadow PC and benefit from the additional feedback on your submission by making your paper available to the shadow PC with no extra overhead. 
Simply indicate your choice in the HotCRP submission site.
