#### CS 4264 (Principles of Computer Security) Spring 2021 at VT
* CS4264 is designed to teach some of the fundamental topics and design principles in modern computer security. This includes security design principles for software systems; Cryptographic models and methods; Threats and defenses in computer operating systems, software, networks, web applications; Privacy, and data protection.

#### [CS 6204 (Public Key Infrastructure and Network Security) Fall 2020 at VT, Spring 2019, 2020 at RIT](./cs6204)
* A public key infrastructure (PKI) provides secure communications between two different entities over an untrusted network. Due to this ability, PKIs are now central to security on the Internet: there are a number of large-scale PKIs in use today such as DNSSEC, HTTPS, and the RPKI. This course examines basic network security models and public key infrastructure that entwines multiple layers of the network stack: application, transport, and network layer. Topics include concepts in basic threat models in networking, public key infrastructure, data-driven approach for securing Internet, etc. Students are required to write critiques on assigned papers, propose and complete a research project individually or in teams, and give presentations on a related topic. This course instance belongs to the Distributed Systems cluster and Security cluster.


#### CSCI-351 (Data Communication and Networks) Fall 2018, 2019 at RIT
* This course is an in-depth study of data communications and networks. The course covers design of, and algorithms and protocols used in, the physical, data link, network, transport, and application layers in the Internet; methods for modeling and analyzing networks and an introduction to network security. Programming projects will be required.
