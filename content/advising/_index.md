### Prospective Students: FAQ
---- 

#### Q: What kinds of research do you do?

I am currently focusing on the Internet Security Protocols that rely on Public Key Infrastructures. More specifically, I am working on (1) TLS (HTTPS), (2) DNSSEC, (3) Routing Security (e.g., RPKI), and (4) Email Security.

#### Q: I have no prior knowledge on how Internet security protocols work.

Don't worry! Here are a few papers you can start with.

##### TLS

* Measuring and Applying Invalid SSL Certificates: The Silent Majority
* <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~dml/papers/crlite_oakland17.pdf">CRLite: A Scalable System for Pushing All TLS Revocations to All Browsers</a>

##### DNSSEC

* A Longitudinal, End-to-End View of the DNSSEC Ecosystem
* Understanding the Role of Registrars in DNSSEC Deployment

##### RPKI

* RPKI is Coming of Age: A Longitudinal Study of RPKI Deployment and Invalid Route Origins
* <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2668966">Why Is It Taking So Long to Secure Internet Routing?</a>

##### Email Security

* Under the Hood of DANE Mismanagement in SMTP
* Youâ€™ve Got Report: Measurement and Security Implications of DMARC Reporting


#### Q: What should I prepare before contacting you?

When you email me regarding your potential admission, please make sure to include the following documents: (1) Transcripts, (2) CV, and (3) List of papers you have read and a brief summary of your takeaways.
